                                data-content="Significant progress has occurred in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), emerging as a crucial technique for monitoring surface deformation. This evolution is attributed to expanded synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data availability and improved data quality. However, effectively managing and processing SAR big data presents substantial challenges for algorithms and pipelines, especially in large-scale contexts. In this article, we introduce a parallel time-series InSAR processing platform that leverages high-performance computing (HPC) clusters for efficiently managing and processing large-scale SAR data and incorporates graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration to significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of specific InSAR processing algorithms. Our approach encompasses high-quality data compression, integration of classic InSAR models, and the introduction of a robust distributed scatterer InSAR method for time-series processing. The platform efficiently handles massive data, featuring a parallel optimization tool for acceleration. In addition, it provides web-based two-dimensional (2-D) result visualization and 3-D outcome representation for comprehensive user understanding. To illustrate our platform's capabilities, we applied it to 40 Sentinel-1 SAR data scenes from Tibet (2017–2019). Our data compression technique notably reduces data size, reducing mask data by 87.5% and coherence data to 25% of its original size. Leveraging HPC and GPU, we achieved a 50% reduction in registration computation time. This study offers valuable insights and a comprehensive platform for InSAR practitioners, facilitating calculations and enhancing comprehension of surface deformation processes. Our system's improved processing efficiency, coupled with a variety of InSAR methods, makes it an alternative choice for InSAR data handling and analysis.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Atmospheric delay (AD) is the main source of error in time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation estimation over large areas. In this study, we propose a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) model to correct random and seasonal ADs adaptively. The BiGRU model decomposes InSAR time-series measurements into non-seasonal and seasonal components by adopting a branched network structure and extracting component-wise features separately. To remove seasonal ADs and meanwhile preserve true seasonal deformation, a dense and fully connected layer with weighted feature learning was designed. Five typical time-series deformation patterns were simulated for model training, and its robustness was evaluated using synthetic data. We applied the trained model to two city clusters in China (Guangdong and Jiangxi-Hunan) using 178 Sentinle-1 images. The results showed that BiGRU with moderate Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) and spatiotemporal filtering (pGA_Fi_BiGRU) reduced the standard deviation of InSAR time-series measurements by 64.3% in the Guangdong region and by 53.5% in the Jiangxi-Hunan region compared with the raw data. Compared with the traditional combined GACOS and spatiotemporal filtering processing methods, the pGA_Fi_BiGRU improved the AD reduction performance by 4.7% and by 8.5% in Guangdong and Jiangxi-Hunan, respectively. The InSAR time-series deformation after pGA_Fi_BiGRU processing removed residual ADs and preserved true deformation, which agreed well with the geodetic leveling and Global Navigation Satellite System data. The first overall subsidence velocity of the Irrawaddy Delta city cluster in Myanmar was then mapped, followed by time-series deformation estimation using pGA_Fi_BiGRU. Representative time-series deformation due to groundwater extraction, coastal erosion, and accretion were properly derived, suggesting that the proposed model can be generalized to other city clusters with different atmospheric noise and geophysical dynamics.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides a unique tool for measuring large-scale and long-term land surface deformation. Under the assumption of a single linear deformation model in conventional InSAR, it is difficult to quantify and interpret the impacts of multiple environmental factors that presumably induce nonlinear deformations. In this paper, we propose a SAR-Transformer method to decompose InSAR time-series signals into various physics-related components and apply the method to evaluate the deformation of the world's longest cross-sea bridge, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB). We first developed an improved bridge geometry-based InSAR network to monitor the deformation of the HZMB using Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed images from 2019 to 2022, which were validated using the leveling and GPS data. The SAR-Transformer model was trained using synthetic InSAR time-series samples and applied to decompose the monitored InSAR measurements. Compared with that of conventional curve-fitting and seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS, SAR-Transformer reduced the mean absolute error at least by 58.32% and mean absolute percentage error at least by 8.84% for time-series signal reconstruction. We evaluated the decomposed patterns according to the geotechnical, meteorological, and marine processes, and found that: 1) Seasonal thermal expansion owing to temperature changes was significant in all parts of the bridge, and deflection due to concrete shrinkage and creep was observed on cable-stayed bridges. 2) The artificial islands experienced evident ground subsidence with a decelerating trend. In particular, the newly adopted non-dredged reclamation method resulted in a lower decelerated settlement than that of fully-dredged reclamation areas. 3) The seawall showed linear horizontal movement from the outward stretching of the reclaimed soil consolidation and periodic displacement related to sea tidal loading. Furthermore, typhoons and coastal earthquakes had limited effects on the permanent movement of the bridge. These results improve the understanding of the interactions between artificial super-infrastructures and environmental factors, and provide valuable guidelines for the maintenance and management of the HZMB.">Abstract</a>

Therefore, traditional texture-based and leader image fixed image registration and persistent scatterer (PS) point selection algorithms cannot be adopted. In this article, a sequential image registration algorithm is proposed based on the preselected PS (prePS) point association for GNSS-based InBSAR systems. First, the prePS points are selected based on the coherence coefficient between theoretical and actual resolution cells. Then, image registration is achieved through prePS point association and subresolution offset estimation, and sequential registration is adopted to replace traditional leader image fixed registration. Finally, PS point selection and interferometric phase extraction are implemented based on the analysis of the resolution cells. Raw data from BeiDou navigation satellites are used to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in GNSS-based InBSAR.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Identifying damaged areas after earthquakes is essential for emergency rescue and rebuilding efforts. Remote sensing image change detection can facilitate these tasks by analyzing features differences between bitemporal/multi-temporal optical images. However, the existing methods still face challenges due to the unpredictable timing, locations, and magnitudes of earthquakes. Firstly, the spectral features of optical images vary over time, making it difficult to differentiate actual damage from areas appearing damaged due to spectral noise. Secondly, variations in earthquake characteristics can cause different types and scales of damage, from individual buildings in urban areas to extensive landslides in mountain areas. Overcoming these variations to establish capabilities for detecting multiple types of damage is also critical. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a change detection network based on the decoupling of context-structural features (referred to as CSDNet). CSDNet uses a CNN-transformer architecture and decouples image features into structural and context branches through a feature difference extractor. Subsequently, the structural branch extracts reliable features through multi-scale consistency feature fusion, ensuring robust damage detection across multiple scales. Context branch facilitates long-range supervision and reduces the impacts of pseudo-changes through partial feature exchange between bitemporal images. Furthermore, to enhance CSDNet’s adaptability across different scenarios and explore CSDNet’s potential for solving multiple tasks within a unified framework, an adaptive module has been designed to dynamically fuse structural and context features. Experiments were conducted on two representative tasks: individual building damage with partial rebuilding and large-scale landslides, to investigate CSDNet’s capabilities. As a result, CSDNet achieved F1-Scores of 92.2% and 90.2% on the two tasks respectively, indicating the effectiveness of CSDNet.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Continuous and large-scale surface deformation monitoring is critical for the comprehension of natural hazards and environmental changes. This can be facilitated by time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR), which provides unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. However, the original TS-InSAR measurements, being a superposition of trend, seasonal, and noise signals, often suffer from outlier and annual seasonal variations due to the influences of atmospheric delay, especially in coastal and mountainous areas, resulting in skewed monitoring if neglected. To address these issues, an integration method of variational mode decomposition and gated recurrent unit (VMD-GRU) is proposed in this study to enhance the robustness of continuous large-scale surface deformation monitoring. The VMD decomposes low-frequency trend, specific-frequency seasonal, and high-frequency noise components from the original TS-InSAR data via frequency-domain variational optimization first. Then, by eliminating the seasonal component decomposed by VMD from the original time series, the time series is reconstructed, effectively removing the influence of annual seasonal variations. Subsequently, GRU is utilized to further eradicate noise from the reconstructed time series, mitigating the influence of outliers and noise, thereby yielding a trend component that intuitively reflects surface deformation. Experiments on physical-based synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed VMD-GRU outperforms the existing methods. By introducing the frequency priors, the proposed method significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of continuous large-scale surface deformation monitoring, providing a more reliable understanding of natural hazards and environmental changes.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Surface melt plays a vital role in impacting the polar mass balance and global sea level rise. Over the past decades, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has garnered considerable attention due to its capacity to provide high-precision and long-term information. However, the traditional SAR-based large-scale surface melt detection methods utilizing co-orbit normalization predominantly depend on reference images and the precise spatial registration to mitigate geometric distortions arising from diverse incidence angles. Consequently, both the absence of reference imagery and the movement of ice sheets and shelves present challenges to the method. In this study, we address this issue by developing a reference-free deep learning network integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into DeepLabv3+ to automatically detect surface melt and establishing the surface melt dataset based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, encompassing diverse surface conditions of the Antarctic. Our model achieves an accuracy of 95.67%, surpassing the reference-based method and an advanced deep learning-based approach by 4.23% and 4.67%, respectively. Moreover, compared to 500 m resolution UMelt product and the kilometer-level results obtained from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), our model demonstrates the capability to accurately capture the small-scale melting patterns of ice shelves with a higher spatial resolution of 40 m. Notably, our findings underscore the dispensability of reference imagery in traditional methods through the formidable information extraction capabilities of deep learning. We finally applied the proposed method to extract and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of surface melt on the Larsen C Ice Shelf during the 2019/2020 period.

                                data-content="Pine Island Glacier (PIG), the largest glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, has contributed to over a quarter of the observed sea level rise around Antarctica. In recent years, multiple observations have confirmed its continuous retreat, ice flow acceleration and profound surface melt. Understanding these changes is crucial for accurately monitoring ice mass discharge and future Antarctic contributions to sea level rise. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the complex interactions between these variables to comprehend how they collectively affect the overall stability of the intricate PIG system. In this study, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing data and deep learning method to detect and analyze the spatio-temporal variations of surface melt, ice shelf calving, and ice flow velocity of the PIG from 2015 to 2023. We explored the correlations among these factors to understand their long-term impacts on the glacier's stability. Our findings reveal a retreat of 26.3 km and a mass loss of 1001.6 km2 during 2015–2023. Notably, extensive surface melting was observed, particularly in the 2016/2017 and 2019/2020 melting seasons. Satellite data vividly illustrate prolonged and intense melting periods, correlating with a significant retreat in the glacier's terminus position in 2019/2020. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of surface melting and the cumulative retreat of the ice shelf from 2017 to 2020 on the PIG shows a temporal relationship with subsequent significant changes in ice flow velocity, ranging from 10.9 to 12.2 m d−1, with an average acceleration rate of 12%. These empirical findings elucidate the intricate relationship among surface melt, ice flow velocity, and consequential glacier dynamics. A profound understanding of these interrelationships holds paramount importance in glacier dynamic changes and modeling, providing invaluable insights into potential glacier responses to global climate change.">Abstract</a>

Consequently, understanding the continuous calving front retreat within the TG is pivotal for accurately monitoring glacier dynamics and future Antarctic impact on global climate change. In this study, based on the novel deep learning method for calving front delineation and the surface melt detection framework, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing data from 2015 to 2023 to analyze continuous calving retreat and the associated influencing factors including surface melt, and ice velocity of the TG. Our findings reveal a retreat of 18.0 km and a mass loss of 226.4km2. Satellite data illustrate prolonged and intense melting periods in the 2016/2017 melting season, correlating with a significant retreat in the glacier's terminus position in early 2017. We also demonstrate that the ice flow velocity on the near the pinning point remains consistently slow and stable (from 0.5 to 1.8 m/day) from 2015 to 2023, while the Thwaites West Ice Tongue (TWIT) undergoes pronounced dynamic variations characterized with higher ice velocities and frequent frontal fluctuations (from 11.4 to 15.7 m/day), subsequently accelerating the calving of the TG. We believe a profound understanding of these interrelationships holds paramount importance in glacier dynamic changes and modeling, providing invaluable insights into potential glacier responses to global climate change and the implementation of SDG13 (Climate Action).">Abstract</a>

However, mining areas are often subjected to severe temporal and geometric decorrelation problems, resulting in sparse persistent scatterers (PSs) and lower measurement accuracy. To improve deformation measurements, a robust multitemporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) method that jointly detects PS and distributed scatterers (DSs) in a two-tier network was utilized here. To solve the mismatch in the traditional linear velocity model, a logistic model was introduced for MT-InSAR processing. Forty-four Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2021 were used to measure ground subsidence in Zhoutaizi Village, Chengde City, Hebei Province, China, which endured geohazards induced and exacerbated by mining activities. We observed that more measurement points were produced using the logistic model (11 607) compared with the constant velocity model (10 980) in the mining areas with an increase of 5.7%, while the mean value of the standard deviation of the estimated residuals reduced from 1.45 to 1.13 with a decrease of 22%. Results are beneficial for geohazard assessment and management in mining areas.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an effective tool for measuring large-scale land subsidence. However, the measurement points generated by InSAR are too many to be manually analyzed, and automatic subsidence detection and classification methods are still lacking. In this study, we developed an oriented R-CNN deep learning network to automatically detect and classify subsidence bowls using InSAR measurements and multi-source ancillary data. We used 541 Sentinel-1 images acquired during 2015–2021 to map land subsidence of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area by resolving persistent and distributed scatterers. Multi-source data related to land subsidence, including geological and lithological, land cover, topographic, and climatic data, were incorporated into deep learning, allowing the local subsidence to be classified into seven categories. The results showed that the oriented R-CNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.847 for subsidence detection and a mean AP (mAP) of 0.798 for subsidence classification, which outperformed the other three state-of-the-art methods (Rotated RetinaNet, R3Det, and ReDet). An independent effect analysis showed that incorporating all datasets improved the AP by 11.2% for detection and the mAP by 73.9% for classification, respectively, compared with using InSAR measurements only. Combining InSAR measurements with globally available land cover and digital elevation model data improved the AP for subsidence detection to 0.822, suggesting that our methods can be potentially transferred to other regions, which was further validated this using a new dataset in Shanghai. These results improve the understanding of deltaic subsidence and facilitate geohazard assessment and management for sustainable environments.">Abstract</a>

Monitoring and understanding land subsidence are crucial for establishing resilient, adaptive, and sustainable environments. In this study, a robust multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR) method was employed to monitor land subsidence in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) using 541 Sentinel-1 SAR images. Spatial auto- and cross-correlation analysis were applied to select the most reasonable explanatory variables from nine candidates in each city of the GBA. City-level geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were then constructed to explore the spatially nonstationary effects of natural and human-induced factors. The findings revealed subsidence velocities ranging from 0 to 83.7 mm/yr in the GBA from 2015 to 2021, with the dominant factors affecting subsidence varying among regions. Natural and human-related factors accounted for 51.13% and 48.87%, respectively. Further analysis of representative subsidence areas highlights the importance of continuous monitoring of ground deformation using MTInSAR, region-specific land subsidence mitigation strategies, and regular maintenance of urban infrastructure. These insights are valuable for policymakers and urban planners in comprehending the complex processes underlying land subsidence and informing decision-making processes for sustainable and resilient urban development.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Urbanization has led to environmental challenges, with the urban heat island effect being a prominent concern. Understanding the influence of urban environmental characteristics (UECs) on land surface temperature (LST) is essential for addressing this issue and promoting sustainable urban development. The spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors of LST have been investigated in past studies, but research that explicitly investigates the key factors and long-term spatial relationships affecting LST in city-scale urban areas is limited. Remote sensing techniques provide valuable insights into LST patterns and the relationship between urban environment and temperature dynamics. We utilized Landsat 8 images to derive the LST and six spectral indices from 2017 to 2022 in Hong Kong, a city characterized by high population density and rapid urban growth. We also acquired land use data to reflect Hong Kong’s dynamic urban landscape. The complex interactions between urban environment and LST were analyzed using various analytical techniques, including slope trend analysis, land use change detection, and correlation analysis. Finally, we constructed a random forest model to assess the importance of each environmental characteristic. Our findings provide three key insights for regions experiencing rapid urbanization. First, the LST showed an increasing trend in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2022, with the annual LST rising from 21.13 °C to 23.46 °C. Second, we identify negative relationships between LST and vegetation (−0.49)/water bodies (−0.49) and a positive correlation between LST and built-up areas (0.56) utilizing Pearson’s correlation. Third, the dominant influence of built-up areas was underscored, contributing as much as 53.4% to elevated LST levels, with specific attention to the substantial reclamation activities in Hong Kong. The insights from this study provide valuable guidance for policymakers, urban planners, and environmental researchers to formulate evidence-based strategies to achieve a resilient, livable urban future.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="Time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides a unique tool for measuring large-scale and long-term land surface deformation. Under the assumption of a single linear deformation model in conventional InSAR, it is challenging to quantify and interpret the impacts of multiple environmental factors presumably inducing nonlinear deformations. In this paper, we propose a SAR-Transformer method to decompose InSAR time-series signals into a variety of physics-related components and apply the method to evaluate the deformation of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB), the world's longest cross-sea bridge. We first developed an improved bridge geometry-based network to monitor the deformation of the HZMB using Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed images from 2019 to 2022, which was validated using the leveling and GPS data. The SAR-Transformer model was trained using synthetic InSAR time-series samples and applied to decompose the monitored InSAR measurements. Compared with conventional curve-fitting and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS, SAR-Transformer reduced the mean absolute percentage error by 8.84% for time-series signal reconstruction. We evaluated the decomposed patterns according to the geotechnical, meteorological, and marine processes, and found that: 1) Seasonal thermal expansion owing to temperature changes was significant in all of the bridge parts, and linear deflection due to concrete shrinkage and creep was mainly observed on cable-stayed bridges. 2) The man-made islands experienced evident ground subsidence with a decelerating trend. Particularly, the newly adopted non-dredged reclamation method resulted in a lower decelerated settlement than fully-dredged reclamation areas. 3) The seawall showed linear horizontal movement from the outward stretching of the reclaimed soil consolidation and periodic displacement related to sea tidal loading. In addition, typhoons and coastal earthquakes had limited effects on the permanent movement of the bridge. These results improved the understanding of the interactions between man-made super-infrastructures and environmental factors, and provide valuable guidelines for the maintenance and management of the HZMB.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="The understanding of glacier and ice shelf front changes is of paramount importance in analyzing their material balance and their significant contributions to global sea-level variations. Recently, the increasing availability of remote sensing images has provided ample data support for calving front detection. By combining massive amounts of data, deep learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in front extraction, as they can automatically generate task-specific features. In this study, in contrast to the traditional framework based on a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we propose a novel calving front detection network, global–local attention Swin-transformer-based DeepLabv3+ (GLA-STDeepLab), by incorporating the Swin-transformer module into DeepLabv3+ to enhance the modeling capability of long-range contextual dependencies. We also introduce global–local attention (GLA) mechanisms into the module, striving to foster interactions between the corresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. Through extensive experimentation on a diverse and challenging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) database, CaFFe, our network is shown to surpass the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving results with an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.94 and a mean distance error (MDE) of 473 ± 34 m. More meaningfully, we extracted the time-series front information of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) from 2015 to 2023 and precisely captured the calving events of the D-28 and D-32 icebergs. The findings demonstrate that our method enables precise monitoring of the dynamic information of glacier and ice shelf fronts, as well as their far-reaching implications for ice sheet mass balance and global climate change.

                                data-content="Frequent anthropogenic activities associated with rapid urbanization may cause ground subsidence and endanger the adjacent buildings. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has generated dense measurement points for large-scale deformation monitoring and risk assessment. However, the applications of InSAR for building deformation and risk level prediction are still rare, especially under complex loading scenarios. In this study, we present an integrated method to monitor and predict building deformation and risk levels using multi-temporal InSAR and numerical modeling. Persistent and distributed scatterers were jointly detected to monitor deformation using TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 images over the Kowloon district of Hong Kong and the Futian district of Shenzhen. First, the building risk level was assessed at the district scale using ground subsidence and angular distortion to identify potentially damaged buildings. 10 out of 807 buildings in the Kowloon and 2 out of 145 buildings in the Futian were classified as medium risk. Back-analysis was used to retrieve the geological and hydrological conditions of buildings at the medium risk level. Then, time-series subsidence of the Lucky and BMW buildings during 2012 to 2016 and the Jingli building during 2010 to 2014 was simulated by numerical modeling, which agreed well with the InSAR measurements. By defining the groundwater level changes and upper loading, the predicted subsidence of the Lucky, BMW, and Jingli buildings reached 47.9, 62.8, and 39.9 mm by 2021, respectively, with a decelerated trend. Time-series results showed that the Lucky and BMW buildings were still at the negligible-to-medium risk level in 2021, and should be constantly inspected; the risk level of the Jingli building became negligible from 2020. This method can be transferred to other rapidly urbanized areas prone to ground subsidence for geohazard assessment and improve the understanding of the dynamic behaviors of anthropogenic activity-induced ground subsidence.">Abstract</a>

                                data-content="The Blue Lentic Belt is a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats formed in the Mobile River Basin since the 1990s, and it is imposing considerable environmental stress on local and downstream aquatic habitats. Depicting the spatiotemporal evolution of the Blue Lentic Belt is essential to understanding its formation and consequential impacts on local environments. However, relevant discussion on it is absent since the Blue Lentic Belt is a new discovery. In this study, we developed a retrospective delineation method to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the Mobile River Basin and a tesseral model to numerically analyze the spatiotemporal expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt. In the developed method, the baseline inventory of lentic habitats is first delineated from 2019 Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at a spatial resolution of 10 m. The baseline inventory is then used to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats in the Mobile River Basin using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Kernel density surfaces of lentic habitat image objects are estimated to detect the regions of dense lentic habitats, which sequentially form spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats. The spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats are projected onto planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae, namely α-peaks, β-slopes, and γ-edges. Attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt. The results indicate that the Blue Lentic Belt has 4 α-peaks, 3 β-slopes, and a single γ-edge. It is formed from 4 stable hotspots (α-peaks) of the densest lentic habitats. The expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt ranges about 15.42 km. The expansion distance is about 0.57 of the average range of the β-slopes in the Blue Lentic Belt, indicating a significant change of landscape in the Mobile River Basin. The development of the farm-raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force in the formation of the Blue Lentic Belt. The outcomes of this study have emphasized the rapid expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt and its negative impacts on local and downstream aquatic habitats, which calls for attention to systemic investigations by multiple disciplines.">Abstract</a>

                            data-content="Topographic phase simulation is important for deformation estimation in differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry. The most commonly used 30 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) is usually required to be resampled due to its relatively low resolution (LR) comparing to the high resolution (HR) SAR images. Although the WorldDEM with a 12 m resolution achieves global coverage, it is not available freely. Consequently, it is useful to evaluate the practicability of the super-resolution (SR) from LR SRTM DEMs to HR WorldDEM ones, which has not been investigated. Most existing DEM SR models are trained with synthetic datasets in which the LR DEMs are downsampled from their HR counterparts. However, these models become less effective when applied to real-world scenarios due to the domain gap between the synthetic and real LR DEMs. In this article, we constructed a real-world DEM SR dataset, where the LR and HR DEMs were collected from SRTM and WorldDEM, respectively. An enhanced SR generative adversarial network model was adapted to train on the dataset. Considering that the real LR-HR pairs may suffer from misalignment, we introduced the perceptual loss for better optimizing the model. Moreover, a logarithmic normalization was proposed to compress the wide elevation range and adjust the uneven distribution. We also pretrained the model using natural images since collecting sufficient HR DEMs is costly. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near 0.69 dB improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, our method is also validated to improve the topographic phase simulation by 23.42% of MSE.">Abstract</a>

However, simple analysis techniques like thresholding cannot detect and locate the widely distributed local-scale subsidence reliably. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based method to automatically detect the local-scale subsidence bowls in the deformation velocity map. To test our method, we choose the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) as the study region, where widespread local-scale subsidence bowls exist associated with the urbanization. Using deformation velocity maps spanning 2015–2017 derived from MT-InSAR, our method detects several subsidence bowls due to dewatering, excavation of foundation pits and subways, and other engineering works. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed method to automatically detect and analyze the local-scale subsidence bowls in the built-up regions.">Abstract</a>

                            data-content="Atmospheric noise is one of the primary challenges for improving the accuracy of deformation estimation by InSAR technologies. Temporal filtering methods, like Gaussian filtering, are commonly used to remove the atmospheric noise from the InSAR time series. Such low-pass filters can effectively suppress stochastic noise. Yet, its performance heavily depends on the parameter settings and can easily be affected by the seasonal variations and missing values presented in the InSAR time series. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully adapted in many time series or sequential data applications. Still, there is little work on exploiting the ability of RNNs for modeling InSAR time series. This paper proposes a bidirectional RNN with gated recurrent units (GRU) for removing the atmospheric noise from the InSAR time series. A physical-based method of synthesizing InSAR time series is developed to tackle the lack of training data problem. The proposed GRU model integrates a GRU-D layer for handling the missing values, and all the model components are jointly trained to produce the denoised time series. Besides, we introduce the seasonal factor (SF) signal as an auxiliary input to help the model better capture the seasonality of the deformation and improve the denoising results. Experiments on synthetic datasets and HKIA real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRU model achieves better denoising performance than Gaussian filtering and other RNN baseline models.">Abstract</a>

However, the resolution limitation of existing digital elevation model (DEM) in the slope areas causes the DEM phase residues and atmospheric effects promoted, which will influence the interpret accuracy of InSAR results. In this study, we propose a novel two-step ESRGAN-based DEM SR method to effectively recover high-resolution DEM from the original version. Firstly, we pretrain an ESRGAN with a large number of natural images. Based on it, we transfer the learnt knowledge into the DEM problem and fine-tune the DEM SR network. The recovered DEMs are utilized as the reference data to improve slope deformation monitoring and enhance the accuracy of InSAR estimation, especially in the mountainous areas with cloudy and rainy weather. Experiments indicate that the proposed method can achieve better results than the traditional methods and works in phase simulation, which is one of the key step of InSAR deformation monitoring.">Abstract</a>
